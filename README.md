This project is an IoT-based smart waste management system that uses an ESP32 and ultrasonic sensors to monitor garbage levels in bins. The data is stored in a MySQL database and visualized on a web dashboard built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Features:
1.Real-time garbage level detection
2.Web-based dashboard for monitoring
3.SQL database integration for data storage
4.Alerts when bins are full
Technologies Used:
Hardware: ESP32, Ultrasonic Sensor
Software: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL
How it Works:
1. Ultrasonic sensor measures garbage level in the bin
2. ESP32 sends data to the MySQL database
3. Web interface displays live data and generates alerts when needed
